# Concurrent Storage System in Java
This is a project written in Java, consisting of the solution code and sample tests provided by the original problem author.  
**Course**: Concurrent Programming (3rd semester, 2023/2024)  
**Degree**: Bachelor's at University of Warsaw  

## About
This project is an implementation of a concurrent storage system in Java. 
It is designed to coordinate data transfers between devices while ensuring safety and liveness properties. 
The system can handle different types of operations on data components, such as adding, moving, and deleting, and prevent any conflicts or inconsistencies.

## Features
- **Concurrent Data Transfers:** The system can manage multiple data transfers concurrently, ensuring efficient use of resources.
- **Safety and Liveness Properties:** The system ensures that all data transfers are safe and live, preventing data loss, corruption, duplication, or deadlock.
- **Conflict Resolution:** The system can detect and resolve conflicts between data transfers, ensuring the consistency of the data.
